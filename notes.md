- High-performance webserver, reverse proxy, load balancer

## Main Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

- Uses an async, non-blocking event loop instead of creating new threads/processes for each request
- Efficiently handles thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource usage

### 2. Modular and configurable

- Configuration is declarative and structured in a hierarchical format

### 3. Reverse Proxy and Load Balancing
